# Sudoku game
Simple pure js+html+css sudoku game

### Todo:
- [ ] Refract JS code (make classes, instead of bunch of functions)
- [ ] Find and fix bug with timer (sometimes it shows random values)
- [ ] Generate HTML game grid in JS (instead of current hardcoded in HTML file)
- [ ] Add score table
- [ ] Maybe show all numbers in select circle (or add switch im menu to disable check for available numbers)?
- [ ] Add several difficulties
